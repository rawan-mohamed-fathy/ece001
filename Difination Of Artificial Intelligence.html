<h2>Artificial Intelligence:</h2>
  <h3> is the ability of a computer program to learn and think. John McCarthy coined the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ in the 1950s.</h3>
    <h3> He said, ‘Every aspect of learning or anyother feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine </h3>
    <h3> can be made to simulate it.An attempt  will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions, and concepts, </h3>
    <h3>solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.</h3>
