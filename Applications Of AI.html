<h3>Fraud Detection:</h3>
<h4>Every time you make a transaction online/offline, using your credit or debit card, you receive a message from your bank asking if you have made that transaction. </h4>
<h4> The bank also asks you to report if you haven’t made the transaction. Banks feed their Artificial Intelligencteme syss with data regarding both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.</h4>
<h4>The AI systems learn from this data and then predict which transactions are fraudulent and which are not based on these huge training datasets.</h4>

<h3>Music and Movie Recommendations:</h3>
<h4>Did you know that Mark Zuckerberg created Synapse, a music player which suggested songs that users would likely listen to? Netflix, Spotify, and Pandora also recommend music and movies </h4>
<h4>for to users based on their past interests and purchases. These sites accomplish this by garnering the choices users had made earlier and providing these choices as inputs into the learning algorithm.</h4>

<h3>AI in Retail:</h3>
<h4>The market size of AI software is expected to reach up to US$36 million by 2025. This hype in the market has caused retailers to pay attention to Artificial Intelligence. Thus, the majority of big </h4>
<h4>and small-scale industries are adopting AI tools in novel ways across the entire product life cycle—right from the assembling stage to the post-sale customer-service interactions.</h4>

<h3>Autopilot Flight:</h3>
<h4>With AI technology, a pilot only needs to put the system on autopilot mode, and then the majority of operations on the flight will be taken care of by AI itself. </h4>
<h4> It is reported by the New York Timesthat only 7 minutes of human intervention (which mostly relates to takeoff and landing) is required for the average flight of a Boeing plane.</h4>
