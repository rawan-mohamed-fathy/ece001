<h4>Artificial Intelligence works with large amounts of data that are first combined with the fast, iterative processing and smart algorithms that allow the system tolearn from the patterns</h4>
<h4>within the data. This way, the system would be able to deliver accurate or close toaccurate outputs.As it sounds, AI is a vast subject, which involves much-advanced and complex processes</h4>
<h4>and itis a field of study thatincludes many theoriesmethods, and technologies. The major subfields under AI are explained below:</h4>

<h3>Machine Learning:</h3>
<h4> Machine Learning is the learning in which a machine can learn on its own from examples and previous experiences. The program developed for it need not be specific and will not be static.</h4>
<h4> The machine tends to change or correct its algorithm as and when required. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are the two most commonly misinterpreted terms.</h4>
<h4>Generally, people tend to understand that they are the same, which leads to confusion. ML is a subfield of AI. However, both terms are recalled simultaneously and repeatedly whenever the topics </h4>
<h4> of Big Data or Data Analytics, or some other related topics, are talked about.</h4>
  
<h3>Neural Networks:</h3>
<h4> Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were developed getting inspired by the biological neural network, i.e., the brain. ANNs are one of the most important tools in Machine Learning to find</h4>
<h4>patterns within the data, which are far too complex for a human to figure out and teach the machine to recognize.</h4>
  
<h3>Deep Learning:</h3>
<h4>In Deep Learning, a large amount of data is analyzed, and here, the algorithm would perform the task repeatedly, each time twisting/editing a little to improve the outcome.</h4>

<h3>Cognitive Computing:</h3>
<h4> The ultimate goal of cognitive computing is to imitate the human thought process in a computer model. How can this be achieved? Using self-learning algorithms, pattern recognition by neural networks</h4>
<h4>and natural language processing, a computer can mimic the human way of thinking. Here, computerized models are deployed to simulate the human cognition process.</h4>


<h3>Computer Vision:</h3>
<h4>Computer vision works on allowing computers to see, recognize, and process images, the same way as the human vision does, and then it provides an appropriate output.</h4>
<h4> Computer vision is closely related to Artificial Intelligence. Here, the computer must understand what it sees, and then analyze it, accordingly.</h4>

<h3>Natural Language Processing:</h3>
<h4>Natural language processing means developing methods that help us communicate with machines using natural human languages like English.</h4>
